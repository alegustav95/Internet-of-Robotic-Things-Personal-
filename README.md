Arduino, PIC, PLC, Python, C/C++ projects

1. Project: A IoT device that measure the soil moisture. Use Arduino or PIC microcontroller for the code part. The values will be seen in a LCD Display. Use Tinkercad for simulation. Testing project.
2. Then it is insert in other project that work as meteo station where measure temperature, pressure, speed and quality air.
3. For design project, I used 3D printer.
4. Using of ESP8266 for controll and programm sensors and set variables meteo station.
